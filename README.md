# `The vessels app`

`vessels` is an interactive map built on shiny that allows you to examine basic patterns of vessel movements in a data set. To use the app, please select a vessel type from the first dropdown menu. Next, choose one of the vessels. For a given vessel, the app will display the origin and ending points of the longest trip.

## How to use `vessels`

`phruta` is currently available through `GitHub` and shinyapp.io. However, the only working version (with a dataset) is in the later source.
